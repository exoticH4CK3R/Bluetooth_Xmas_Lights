This is just a project I made to make christmas this year a hell of a lot more interesting (for me)
The Circuit consists of the following:
1X Arduino Uno,
1X HC-06 BlueTooth Module,
1X 5M (meter) RGB LED Strip,
1X Jiffy Project Enclosure,
(ALOT)X Jumper Cables,
1X 2.1MM Jack,
1X SPDT Toggle Switch,
1X Android device (Bluetooth Compatible),
1X RGBLights.APK,
1X RGB_LIGHTS.INO,
1X USB Cable (for proggramming),
1X PC or Mac with Arduino and MIT App inventor 2


The password for the app is "santa" (without "" marks)
